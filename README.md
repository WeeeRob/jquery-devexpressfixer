# jquery-devexpressfixer #

Version: 0.0.1a, Last updated: 30/08/2012

A plug-in to fix up the DevExpress controls callbacks so we can provide the request verificaiton token

I have a problem with the DevExpress (http://www.devexpress.com/) MVC controls and enabling the MVC RequestVerificationToken everywhere in that DevExpress doesn't seem to think this is necessary. However with a bit of jiggerypokery it can be resolved so this plug-in does that for you. 

Also it uses the client API to provide change events when elements are changed, for the hidden fields.
